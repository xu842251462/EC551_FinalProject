Product description
The RP-C flexible thin film pressure sensor is composed of polyester film of excellent comprehensive mechanical properties, high conductive material and nano-scale pressure sensitive material; the top is a flexible film and pressure sensitive layer above, the bottom is a flexible film and conductive circuit above.Both are glued by double-sided adhesive and the isolation sensitive zone.When there is pressure on sensitive area, the disconnected circuit on the bottom will be connected by top pressure-sensitive layer, and the output resistance of the port changes along with pressure.
